The question to answer: Given different scenarios/locations, what are the best transportation options? Consider all costs, usability favoribility, weather, etc.

Our code for this hackathon can take in various inputs such as population density heat maps, current roads, peak hours, and also simulate several different types of routes in a software called SIMIO. Through running our simulation model, we would be able to pinpoint areas of concern and feed that back into our code for further analysis.
